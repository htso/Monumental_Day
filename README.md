# A Monumental Day in the Stock Market
## -- Jun 5, 2020

### Introduction

Today is a monumental day in the history of stock market. The Nasdaq 100 index, which represents some of the biggest and best known companies in the world, has just completed a round trip. Starting from a record high on Feb 20, it crashed 28% into a bear market, troughed on Mar 19, and rose all the way back to a new record high today. All that happened in 76 days. That's just a little longer than one quarter, and crossed over the reporting period of a typical money manager.

A month ago we saw a chorus of bears calling for an imminent drop in the market. They showed a degree of conviction rarely seen in the investment advisory business. One headline reads "__The Crash Has Only Just Begun__(Apr 28)"[1]. Another told investors "_How To Trade a Second Coronavirus Stock Market Crash_(May 5)"[2]. And their reasons are well articulated -- "_4 Reasons Why The Market Will Dive Again_(May 4)"[3]. My favorite is "_Continued Selling For Next Week, More Losses Set_(May 1)"[4] where the author committed the mortal sin of predicting both the direction and the timing.

The reasoning of these calls varied from fundamentals ("the market is the most expensive since 19XX") to technical ("we've hit the 6X% Fibonacci retracement"). But underlying their arguments is one central belief that a bear market obeys some fundamental law of progression. It starts with a sharp decline of more than 20%, to be followed by an equally sharp rebound, then drifts lower until the previous low is "retested". It is only after this "retesting" phase fully played out that one could confidently step in to buy. 

### No Historic Precedent

So, did this happen before? Let's look at the data. I coded a R script that searches for similar pattern in historic data. I ran it on all the major market indices available to me[2], which include 92 years of S&P 500 index since 1927, 49 years of Nasdaq Composite, the history of the British market, the German market, and 10 other stock markets around the world. 

Finding : Nothing like this has happened before. No precedent of a drop and then a complete recovery inside a quarter. There has been some highly volatile trajectories in Nasdaq. The closest ever to a round trip was the path in second half of 2001, during Internet Bubble. This' by no mean exhaustive of history, but it's enough to show that what just happened is quite unusual. I'll discuss some coding detail in the last section.

### How is it possible?

I have three observations/hypotheses that I find useful to make sense of what's been happening in the stock market. 

This coronavirus pandemic has created some highly visible damage to the economy. Unlike the subprime crisis in 2008 where the initial impact showed up in some obscure corner of Wall Street, this crisis feels very real. People all over the world could see their neighborhood shops, restaurants, and businesses closed down. Large number of people lost their jobs. The fear generated by the shutdown is felt in a broad spectrum of the society. 

As human we have this cognitive mechanism that responds to visible stimulus by taking action. With convenient access to brokerage account, it's so easy to sell everything. One push of a button and you are all in cash and you feel safe. 

So, my first hypothesis is about the behavorial bias resulted from the recent events. Many long term investors might have sold into the decline in the March. As economic data continue to show the enormous damage in the real economy, few of them have moved back into stocks. The market is going up to make sure these people would buy back at some point, at higher prices. 

The second hypothesis is about the changing mix of stock market participants. It is well documented that as much as 90% of the volume in a typical day is from HFT algorithms taking advantge of some nanosecond price movements. These algorithms don't know and don't care about long term price patterns based on century-old theory of market cycle. An index level such as the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement has no significance to these machine learning models trained on level-agnostic return data. Very few machine learning models could learn directly from level data because stock prices are inherently nonstationary and are therefore difficult to learn.

However, I do not dismiss the usefulness of level data. With enough level data, a good model could be trained to make long term prediction. 

And that brings me to my third observation : the belief about how a bear market should behave has very little statistically support. And that is because we have very few data points available to evaluate any hypothesis of the sort akin to the Dow theory. Over the last one hundred years, there were just six bear markets ever occurred in the US, and less than 20 over the developed world[5]. Many of the bear markets lasted a very short time, such as the stock market crash in 1987. And some of them are double-counts. Any model built from 10 or 20 data points would have little statistical signficance and a large margin of error. 

Therefore, as we're witnessing at the moment, a bear market does not need a third leg down to retest the previous low. Any stretegy relying on such a pattern would suffer enormous variance.
